## Coverage Calculation

```typescript
// Feature Coverage = (Completed Tests / Total Tests) × 100
// Overall Coverage = Weighted average by priority

const calculateCoverage = (feature) => {
  const completed = feature.unitCompleted + feature.integrationCompleted + feature.e2eCompleted;
  const total = feature.unitTotal + feature.integrationTotal + feature.e2eTotal;
  return (completed / total) * 100;
};

const weights = {
  CRITICAL: 1.5,
  HIGH: 1.2,
  MEDIUM: 1.0,
  LOW: 0.8
};
```

## Test Count Guidelines

### How to Determine Test Counts

**Unit Tests:**
- 1 test per public method
- 1 test per error condition
- 2-3 tests for edge cases
- 3-5 tests for security validation

**Integration Tests:**
- 1 test per API interaction
- 1 test per component boundary
- 1 test for error propagation

**E2E Tests:**
- 1 test per user workflow
- 1 test for happy path
- 1 test for error recovery
