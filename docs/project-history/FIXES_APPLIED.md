**QA Manager:** Marcus Johnson

## ‚úÖ All Issues Fixed

### 1. ‚úÖ Network Error on Create Image - FIXED
**Problem:** Creating image from distro context menu showed "Network Error"  
**Root Cause:** ErrorHandler.ts incorrectly classified errors containing "download" as network errors  
**Fix Applied:** 
- Removed 'download' from network error detection (line 171)
- Added proper handling for "not available locally" errors
- Network errors now only triggered by actual network issues

### 2. ‚úÖ Deleted Distro Still Downloadable - FIXED
**Problem:** When deleting a distro, it disappeared from download list  
**Root Cause:** DistroManager completely removed distros from catalog instead of marking unavailable  
**Fix Applied:**
- Default distros now stay in catalog when deleted
- Marked as `available: false` instead of removing
- Custom distros still removed completely
- Download list always shows all default distros

### 3. ‚úÖ Terminal Button Activation - FIXED
**Problem:** Terminal button only worked on direct click, not image click  
**Root Cause:** Terminal was only in "inline" group  
**Fix Applied:**
- Added openTerminal to regular context menu group
- Now appears in both inline and regular menu
- Works on both button click and image right-click

### 4. ‚úÖ Create Image from Image in Context Menu - FIXED
**Problem:** Missing "Create Image from Image" in image context menu  
**Root Cause:** Command existed but wasn't in package.json context menu  
**Fix Applied:**
- Added to view/item/context for images
- Updated command to handle context menu parameter
- Now works from both context menu and command palette

### 5. ‚úÖ Period Character in Names - FIXED
**Problem:** Names like "ubuntu-24.04" rejected despite having periods  
**Root Cause:** Inconsistent validation - inline regex didn't match InputValidator  
**Fix Applied:**
- All commands now use `InputValidator.validateDistributionName()`
- Removed inline regex `/^[a-zA-Z0-9-_]+$/`
- Now consistently allows: letters, numbers, dots, dashes, underscores

## üìÅ Files Modified

1. **src/errors/errorHandler.ts**
   - Line 171: Removed 'download' from network detection
   - Lines 159-163: Added proper distro not found handling

2. **src/distros/DistroManager.ts**
   - Lines 313-347: Keep default distros in catalog when deleted

3. **package.json**
   - Lines 191-229: Added createImageFromImage to context menu
   - Reorganized menu groups for better UX

4. **src/extension.ts**
   - Lines 522-530, 575-583, 628-636: Use InputValidator consistently
   - Lines 552-580: Handle context menu parameter for createImageFromImage

5. **test/integration/realTests.test.ts** (NEW)
   - Created REAL integration tests that test actual code
   - No mocks - tests real functionality

## ‚úÖ Verification

All tests passing:
```
Total Tests: 10
‚úÖ Passed: 10
‚ùå Failed: 0
Pass Rate: 100.0%
```

## üéØ Key Lesson Learned

**Tests must test REAL code, not mocks!**

The original tests were testing test code, not the actual implementation. The new integration tests in `realTests.test.ts` actually:
- Import real modules
- Test real error messages
- Verify actual behavior
- Check package.json configuration

## How to Test Manually

1. **Network Error Fix:** Right-click distro ‚Üí Create Image ‚Üí Should NOT show network error
2. **Deleted Distro:** Delete a distro ‚Üí Check download list ‚Üí Should still be there
3. **Terminal:** Click on image (not terminal button) ‚Üí Should show terminal in menu
4. **Clone Image:** Right-click image ‚Üí "Create Image from Existing Image" should appear
5. **Periods:** Create image named "test-24.04" ‚Üí Should be accepted

All issues are now resolved and properly tested.
