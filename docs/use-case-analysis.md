# VSCode WSL Manager - First-Class Use Cases Research

## Executive Summary
VSCode WSL Manager addresses a critical gap in modern development: the need for multiple, isolated, purpose-built development environments that can be easily created, cloned, shared, and destroyed without affecting each other. This research identifies key use cases that would massively benefit from isolated, managed WSL images.

## 1. AI-Powered Terminal Coding Assistants (Primary Driver)

Terminal-based AI assistants are CLI-based coding agents that enable direct interaction with your local codebase through file-aware editing that reads, writes, and modifies local code files directly.

### Key Tools

#### Claude Code
- **Requirements**: Requires WSL on Windows (doesn't run natively)
- **Capabilities**: Agentic CLI interface for Claude models (3.5, 3.7, 4.0)
- **Use Case**: Project-specific AI assistance with file edits, bug fixes, merge resolution, and test execution
- **Integration**: Can connect to VS Code and Cursor through IDE integration

#### Aider
- **Models**: Works with Claude 3.7 Sonnet, DeepSeek R1 & Chat V3, OpenAI o1, o3-mini & GPT-4o
- **Capabilities**: Makes a map of your entire codebase, which helps it work well in larger projects
- **Features**: Automatic commits with sensible messages, git integration, voice interaction
- **Languages**: Python, JavaScript, Rust, Ruby, Go, C++, PHP, HTML, CSS, and dozens more

#### Cline
- **Architecture**: Runs entirely client-side with your API keys
- **Capabilities**: Execute commands, read outputs, and debug errors directly in terminal
- **Features**: Model-agnostic (Claude 3.5 Sonnet, Gemini 2.5 Pro, DeepSeek)
- **Security**: Code never touches external servers, ideal for enterprises

#### Gemini CLI
- **Provider**: Google's new open-source AI agent
- **Access**: Free tier with personal Google account
- **Integration**: Shares technology with Gemini Code Assist
- **Context**: 1 million token context window with Gemini 2.5 Pro

### Why They Need Isolated Images
- Each project requires different language versions, dependencies, and tools
- AI agents can make extensive modifications that shouldn't affect other projects
- Clean environments prevent cross-contamination of dependencies
- Easy rollback if AI makes problematic changes
- Different API keys and model configurations per project
- Testing AI-generated code in safe environments

## 2. IDE-Integrated AI Development (Cursor, Windsurf)

Both Cursor and Windsurf are VS Code forks with AI that require WSL setup on Windows, built specifically for AI-assisted development that integrates directly with your development environment.

### Cursor
- **Philosophy**: "The AI code editor that lets you write code using instructions"
- **Features**: AI chat interface side-by-side with code, Cursor Tab (AI-powered autocomplete)
- **Integration**: Requires WSL for Windows users, complex initial setup
- **Models**: GPT-4o, o1, Claude 3.5 Sonnet, custom cursor-small model

### Windsurf (formerly Codeium)
- **Approach**: Maintains developer flow with Cascade AI assistant
- **Features**: Hybrid model using in-house AI for unlimited autocompletion
- **Pricing**: Generous free tier (25 credits/month for premium LLMs)
- **Compatibility**: Most VS Code extensions work seamlessly

### Key Benefits of Image Management
- Separate environments for different AI models and configurations
- Project-specific tool chains without conflicts
- Clean testing environments for AI-generated code
- Isolated spaces for experimenting with different AI workflows
- Different extension sets for different projects

## 3. DevOps and Infrastructure-as-Code Workflows

Tools like Terraform manage infrastructure as code, Kubernetes manages containerized applications, and Ansible automates configuration tasks, all of which complement each other in the DevOps lifecycle.

### Critical Tools

#### Terraform
- **Purpose**: Infrastructure provisioning and management
- **Challenges**: Different versions for different cloud providers/projects
- **Use Cases**: Multi-cloud deployments, version-specific configurations

#### Ansible
- **Purpose**: Configuration management and automation
- **Challenges**: Playbook development with specific Python dependencies
- **Use Cases**: Different Python environments, module requirements

#### Kubernetes Tools
- **Components**: kubectl, helm, k9s with cluster-specific configs
- **Challenges**: Version compatibility with different clusters
- **Use Cases**: Multi-cluster management, testing deployments

#### Docker
- **Purpose**: Container management and building
- **Challenges**: Different daemon configurations per project
- **Use Cases**: Build environments, registry configurations

### Use Case Scenarios
- AWS project with Terraform 1.5 + AWS CLI v2
- Azure project with Terraform 1.6 + Azure CLI
- On-premise K8s with specific kubectl versions

    "Project A - Node 18": {
      "path": "wsl.exe",
      "args": ["-d", "image-project-a-node18"]
    },
    "Client B - Python ML": {
      "path": "wsl.exe",
      "args": ["-d", "image-client-b-ml"]
    }
  }
}
```
