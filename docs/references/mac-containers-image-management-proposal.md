# Mac Container Image Management Extension Proposal

## Executive Summary

This proposal outlines the addition of container image management capabilities to the VSC WSL Manager extension for macOS users. This feature would provide developers with isolated, containerized development environments accessible directly through VS Code terminals, mirroring the WSL experience available on Windows.

**Key Benefits:**
- Isolated development environments without system pollution
- Instant environment switching via VS Code UI
- Team collaboration through shared container definitions
- Cross-platform parity with WSL functionality

## Problem Statement

### Current Challenges for Mac Developers

1. **Version Conflicts**: Multiple projects requiring different language versions (Python 3.8 vs 3.12, Node 16 vs 20)
2. **System Pollution**: Installing numerous databases, runtimes, and tools clutters the host system
3. **Environment Drift**: Local development environments diverge from production over time
4. **Team Inconsistency**: "Works on my machine" problems due to different local setups
5. **Resource Waste**: Always-running services consuming system resources
6. **Migration Complexity**: Difficult to replicate environments when switching machines

### Gap in Current Tooling

While Docker Desktop exists, there's no seamless VS Code integration for:
- Visual container management
- One-click terminal access to containers
- Container lifecycle management within the editor
- Integration with VS Code's workspace and terminal profiles

## Proposed Solution

### Container Image Manager for macOS

Extend the existing VSC WSL Manager to include container image management capabilities that provide:

1. **Visual Container Management**: Tree view of available containers and images
2. **Integrated Terminal Access**: Direct terminal connections to running containers
3. **Lifecycle Management**: Start, stop, create, and destroy containers from VS Code
4. **Environment Templates**: Pre-configured development environments
5. **Team Sharing**: Export/import container configurations

### Core Features

#### 1. Container Discovery and Management
- List available Docker/Podman images
- Display running containers with status indicators
- Quick actions: start, stop, restart, remove

#### 2. Terminal Integration
- One-click terminal access to any running container
- Integration with VS Code terminal profiles
- Support for multiple terminal sessions per container

#### 3. Environment Templates
- Pre-built development environments (Node.js, Python, Go, etc.)
- Custom Dockerfile generation wizard
- Docker Compose integration for multi-service environments

#### 4. Resource Management
- Container resource monitoring (CPU, memory usage)
- Automatic cleanup of stopped containers
- Volume and network management

## Technical Requirements

### Supported Container Runtimes

**Primary Support:**
- Docker Desktop (most common)
- OrbStack (performance optimized)

**Secondary Support:**
- Podman (rootless containers)
- Colima (lightweight Docker alternative)

### System Requirements

- macOS 10.15 (Catalina) or later
- VS Code 1.70.0 or later
- Container runtime installed (Docker Desktop/OrbStack/Podman)
- Node.js 16+ (for extension development)

## Detailed Use Cases

### Use Case 1: Multi-Project Web Developer

**Scenario**: Developer working on 3 different client projects simultaneously

**Container Setup**:
- **Client A**: Python 3.8 + Django 3.2 + PostgreSQL 13
- **Client B**: Node.js 16 + React 17 + MongoDB 4.4
- **Client C**: Go 1.19 + Gin + Redis 6.2

**Workflow**:
1. Select project in VS Code workspace switcher
2. Container manager automatically shows relevant containers
3. One-click terminal access to appropriate environment
4. All dependencies isolated and ready to use

### Use Case 2: DevOps Engineer

**Scenario**: Managing infrastructure across multiple cloud providers

**Container Setup**:
- **AWS Environment**: Terraform 1.3 + AWS CLI + kubectl 1.25
- **Azure Environment**: Terraform 1.4 + Azure CLI + Helm 3.10
- **Testing Environment**: Ansible + Python 3.11 + various cloud SDKs

**Benefits**:
- No version conflicts between cloud tools
- Isolated credentials and configurations
- Rapid environment switching for different clients

### Use Case 3: Open Source Contributor

**Scenario**: Contributing to various open source projects with different requirements

**Container Setup**:
- **Kubernetes Project**: Go 1.20 + kind + kubectl
- **React Project**: Node.js 18 + npm 9 + testing frameworks
- **Python Library**: Python 3.11 + poetry + pytest

**Benefits**:
- Exact development environment matching project requirements
- No interference between project dependencies
- Easy onboarding for new contributors

## Implementation Plan
