> 🚧 **Pre-Alpha Software**: This project is in active development and **does not yet work**. We're building in public and would love your feedback on our approach and planned features. Star the repo to follow our progress!

## ⚠️ Work in Progress Notice

**This extension is not functional yet.** We're in the very early stages of development, building the foundation with security and quality in mind from day one. 

### Current Status
- 🚧 **Core Functionality**: In development (0% functional)
- 📝 **Documentation**: Being written (optimistically forward-looking)
- 🧪 **Testing**: Infrastructure ready, tests pass, but testing non-functional code
- 🔒 **Security**: Implementing best practices from the start
- 📦 **Installation**: Don't install this yet - it won't do anything!

### What Works Right Now
- ✅ The code compiles (that's something! 🎉)
- ✅ Tests pass (they test our plans, not working features)
- ✅ Documentation exists (describing what we're building)
- ❌ **Actual WSL management**: Nope, not yet!

## 🎯 What We're Building

VSC WSL Manager will be a comprehensive VS Code extension for managing Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) distributions with enterprise-grade security and seamless terminal integration.

### Planned Features
- 🖥️ **Visual WSL Management**: View and manage all WSL distributions in VS Code sidebar
- ➕ **Create Distributions**: Clone existing distributions for isolated environments
- 📦 **Import/Export**: Backup and restore distributions via TAR files
- 🔌 **Terminal Integration**: Automatic terminal profile registration
- 📊 **Real-time Status**: Monitor distribution states with live updates
- 🔒 **Security First**: Input validation, rate limiting, audit logging

## 🤝 Contributing - Ideas & Feedback Welcome!

### 📢 Current Contribution Status

We're currently **accepting ideas and feedback only** - not code contributions or pull requests. This temporary approach allows us to rapidly establish core functionality while still benefiting from community input.

**Why this approach?**
- Enables faster initial development for essential features
- Ensures consistent architecture and security implementation
- Allows us to reach a stable foundation quickly

**This is temporary!** Once we have a solid base, we'll open up for full community contributions.

## 🛠️ Development Setup

**⚠️ Remember: This doesn't actually do anything useful yet!**

But if you want to explore the code, provide feedback, or just see how we're building this:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/your-username/vsc-wsl-manager.git
cd vsc-wsl-manager

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Try to compile (this should work!)
npm run compile

# Run tests (they pass! But test non-functional code)
npm test

# Open in VS Code
code .

# Press F5 to run the extension
# (It will load but won't do anything useful yet)
```

If you somehow get it doing something useful, **please tell us how!** We'd love to know. 😄

See [docs/SETUP.md](docs/SETUP.md) for detailed setup instructions (also forward-looking).

## 📊 Project Transparency

We believe in radical transparency. Here's exactly where we are:

| Metric | Status |
|--------|--------|
| **Development Stage** | Pre-alpha (nothing works) |
| **Code Completeness** | ~10% (structure only) |
| **Test Coverage** | 80% (of planned architecture) |
| **Security Implementation** | 30% (framework in place) |
| **Documentation** | 60% (very optimistic) |
| **Actual Functionality** | 0% (being honest here) |

### Why Open Source from Day One?

- **Learn in Public**: Our mistakes and learnings might help others
- **Early Feedback**: Avoid building features nobody wants
- **Community Input**: Your feedback shapes the project
- **Accountability**: Public development keeps us motivated
- **Transparency**: You can see exactly how software is built from scratch

## 🔄 Alternatives While You Wait

Since we're not ready yet, here are working alternatives:

- [Windows Terminal](https://github.com/microsoft/terminal) - Has some WSL integration features
- [WSL Utilities](https://github.com/wslutilities/wslu) - Command-line WSL utilities
- Manual WSL commands - See [Microsoft's documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/)
- VS Code's built-in WSL support - [Remote - WSL extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-wsl)

We're studying these tools to understand how we can provide unique value!

## 📚 Documentation

Yes, we wrote documentation for features that don't exist yet. We're optimistic like that! 

- [Getting Started Guide](docs/guides/getting-started.md) - For the future when it works
- [Architecture Overview](docs/architecture/overview.md) - Our plans and design
- [Security Model](docs/architecture/security.md) - Security from day one
- [Contributing Guidelines](CONTRIBUTING.md) - How to help us build this
- [FAQ](docs/guides/faq.md) - Mostly "When will it work?" (soon!)
