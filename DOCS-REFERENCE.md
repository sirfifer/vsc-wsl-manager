## ü§ñ AI Agent Guidelines

### For AI Coding Assistants

When working with this codebase, AI agents should:

1. **Always read CLAUDE.md first** - Contains mandatory validation steps and testing requirements
2. **Check /docs/references/** - Contains AI-injected information about cross-platform development
3. **Review /test-workspace/** - Contains work-in-progress items and testing status
4. **Follow the NO MOCKS policy** - All tests must use real implementations
5. **Run mandatory validation** - Complete all steps in CLAUDE.md before declaring work done

### Special AI Information Folders

These folders are specifically maintained for AI agent consumption:

- **/docs/references/** - Cross-platform development guidelines and proposals
- **/test-workspace/** - Current work items and testing progress
- **/docs/agents-ai/** - AI agent configuration and integration guides
