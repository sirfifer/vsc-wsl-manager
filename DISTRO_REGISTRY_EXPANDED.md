# Distribution Registry Expansion Complete

## âœ… Changes Applied

### 1. Auto-Restore Missing Default Distributions
The DistroManager now automatically restores any missing default distributions when loading the catalog. This ensures that even if a default distro was deleted before the fix, it will be restored on next extension load.

### 2. Expanded Registry from 6 to 24 Distributions

#### Previous Limited List (6):
- Ubuntu 22.04, Ubuntu 24.04
- Debian 12
- Alpine 3.19
- Fedora 39
- Arch Linux

#### New Comprehensive List (24):

**Ubuntu Family (4)**
- Ubuntu 24.04 LTS (Latest LTS)
- Ubuntu 22.04 LTS (Current stable)
- Ubuntu 20.04 LTS (Previous LTS)
- Ubuntu 23.10 (Latest non-LTS)

**Debian Family (2)**
- Debian 12 (Bookworm - Stable)
- Debian 11 (Bullseye - Previous stable)

**Enterprise Linux (3)**
- Rocky Linux 9 (RHEL compatible)
- AlmaLinux 9 (RHEL compatible)
- Oracle Linux 9

**Fedora Family (2)**
- Fedora 40 (Latest)
- Fedora 39

**Arch Family (2)**
- Arch Linux (Rolling release)
- Manjaro (User-friendly Arch)

**openSUSE Family (2)**
- openSUSE Leap 15.5 (Stable)
- openSUSE Tumbleweed (Rolling)

**Security Distributions (2)**
- Kali Linux 2024.1 (Penetration testing)
- Parrot Security OS 6.0 (Security & privacy)

**Alpine Linux (2)**
- Alpine 3.20 (Latest)
- Alpine 3.19

**Developer Focused (5)**
- CentOS Stream 9 (RHEL upstream)
- Void Linux (Independent with runit)
- Gentoo Linux (Source-based)
- Clear Linux (Intel optimized)

## ðŸ”§ How It Works

1. **On Extension Load:**
   - Loads existing catalog
   - Checks for any missing default distros
   - Automatically adds missing ones back
   - Marks them as `available: false` (not downloaded)

2. **Download List:**
   - Shows ALL distributions (downloaded and not)
   - Downloaded ones can be re-downloaded if needed
   - Deleted distros are restored automatically

3. **Permanent Registry:**
   - Default distros can never be permanently removed
   - Custom imported distros can still be fully deleted
   - Registry always shows full selection

## ðŸ“‹ Next Steps

When you launch the extension:
1. The catalog will automatically update with all 24 distributions
2. Any previously deleted defaults (Ubuntu 22.04, Fedora 39, Arch) will be restored
3. All distributions will appear in the download list
4. You can download any distribution you want

## ðŸŽ¯ Result

You now have a comprehensive selection of Linux distributions to choose from:
- Enterprise options for production use
- Security distributions for testing
- Lightweight options for containers
- Developer-focused distributions
- Both stable and rolling releases

The registry will never lose default distributions again, ensuring a consistent experience.
