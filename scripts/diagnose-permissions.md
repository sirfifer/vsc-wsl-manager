# Permission Diagnostics

## Current Status
- ✅ `.claude/settings.json` exists with correct format
- ❌ Commands are still prompting for permission
- ❌ Autonomous iteration is blocked

## Troubleshooting Steps

### 1. Check Claude Code Settings Recognition

The `.claude/settings.json` file should be automatically recognized. If not:

1. **Restart Claude Code** - Close and reopen to reload settings
2. **Check for syntax errors** - Ensure JSON is valid
3. **Verify file location** - Must be in `.claude/` directory at project root

### 2. Test Alternative Permission Formats

If basic format isn't working, try these variations:

```json
// Option A: Without parentheses
"allow": [
  "Bash npm run compile",
  "Bash npm run quick-test"
]

// Option B: With wildcards
"allow": [
  "Bash(npm run *)",
  "Bash(npm *)"
]

// Option C: Full command path
"allow": [
  "Bash(/usr/bin/npm run compile)",
  "Bash(/usr/local/bin/npm run compile)"
]
```

### 3. Check Global Settings

Your user settings might be overriding project settings. Check:
- `~/.claude/settings.json` - Global user settings
- Any environment variables affecting Claude Code

### 4. Test Minimal Permission

Create a minimal test to isolate the issue:

```json
{
  "permissions": {
    "allow": ["Bash(echo test)"]
  }
}
```

If `echo test` still prompts, the settings aren't being loaded.

### 5. Manual Test Commands

Try running these directly to see which prompt and which don't:

```bash
echo "Testing permissions"  # Should work if Bash is allowed
npm --version              # Tests npm access
npm run compile            # Tests specific npm script
node --version             # Tests node access
```

## Resolution Options

### Option 1: User-Level Settings
Add permissions to `~/.claude/settings.json` (global):
```bash
mkdir -p ~/.claude
cp .claude/settings.json ~/.claude/settings.json
```

### Option 2: Simplified Permissions
Try a broader permission that might work:
```json
{
  "permissions": {
    "allow": ["Bash"]  // Allow all Bash commands (less secure)
  }
}
```

### Option 3: Safe Runner Approach
Use the safe runner as primary method:
```bash
node scripts/safe-runner.js compile
node scripts/safe-runner.js quick-test
```

## Current Workaround

Until permissions work autonomously, you can:
1. Manually approve each command when prompted
2. Use broader permissions temporarily
3. Run commands in batch to minimize prompts

## Next Steps

1. **Test if settings are loaded**: Run `echo test` - if it prompts, settings aren't loaded
2. **Try global settings**: Copy to `~/.claude/settings.json`
3. **Check Claude Code version**: Ensure you have the latest version
4. **Report findings**: Note which commands work without prompting

The validation script (`validate-autonomous.ts`) is ready to test once permissions are working.
