## Legend

### Status Indicators
- ðŸŸ¢ **Complete**: Feature fully tested with >90% coverage
- ðŸŸ¡ **In Progress**: Partial test coverage (10-90%)
- ðŸ”´ **Not Started**: No tests written yet (<10%)

### Priority Levels
- **Critical**: Must have 100% coverage before release
- **High**: Should have >80% coverage
- **Medium**: Target 70% coverage
- **Low**: Nice to have, >50% coverage acceptable

### Test Count Format
- Format: `completed/total`
- Example: `3/5` means 3 tests completed out of 5 planned

## Critical Path Features
These features must maintain 100% coverage at all times:
1. **WSL-001**: List Distributions - Core functionality
2. **WSL-002**: Clone Distribution - Primary use case
3. **TERM-001**: Open Terminal - Essential integration
4. **UI-001**: Distro Tree View - Main UI component
5. **CMD-001**: Command Registration - All commands must work
6. **SEC-001**: Input Sanitization - Security critical
7. **AI-003**: Environment Isolation - Key value proposition
8. **EXT-001**: Activation Events - Extension must activate cleanly

## Test Writing Priority Queue
Based on priority and the TDD approach (test first, then implement):

### Sprint 1: Foundation (Week 1-2)
- [ ] EXT-001: Activation Events
- [ ] WSL-001: List Distributions
- [ ] UI-001: Distro Tree View
- [ ] CMD-001: Command Registration

### Sprint 2: Core WSL Features (Week 3-4)
- [ ] WSL-002: Clone Distribution
- [ ] WSL-003: Delete Distribution
- [ ] SEC-001: Input Sanitization
- [ ] TERM-001: Open Terminal

### Sprint 3: Terminal & UI (Week 5-6)
- [ ] TERM-002: Auto Profile Registration
- [ ] UI-002: Image Tree View
- [ ] UI-003: Tree Refresh
- [ ] CMD-002: Command Validation

### Sprint 4: AI Tool Support (Week 7-8)
- [ ] AI-003: Environment Isolation
- [ ] AI-001: Aider Integration
- [ ] AI-002: Claude Code Support
- [ ] WSL-004: Import Distribution

### Sprint 5: Security & Polish (Week 9-10)
- [ ] SEC-002: Rate Limiting
- [ ] SEC-003: Audit Logging
- [ ] WSL-005: Export Distribution
- [ ] EXT-002: Configuration

## Coverage Goals by Milestone

| Milestone | Target Date | Overall Coverage | Critical Path | Notes |
|-----------|------------|------------------|---------------|-------|
| Pre-Alpha | - | 20% | 40% | Basic functionality |
| Alpha | - | 40% | 60% | Core features working |
| Beta | - | 60% | 80% | AI tools integrated |
| RC1 | - | 75% | 95% | Security hardened |
| Release | - | 80% | 100% | Production ready |

## Test Debt Tracking

| Feature | Technical Debt | Impact | Resolution Plan |
|---------|---------------|--------|-----------------|
| WSL-002 | Need to test piping between export/import | High | Add integration tests for streaming |
| TERM-002 | Terminal profiles vary by VS Code version | Medium | Test against multiple VS Code versions |
| AI-001 | Aider command variations | Medium | Parametrize tests for different Aider configs |
| SEC-001 | Unicode in distribution names | Low | Add edge case tests |

## Notes for Contributors

### How to Update This Document
1. When starting work on a feature, update status to ðŸŸ¡
2. Write tests FIRST (TDD approach)
3. Update test counts as you write tests
4. Calculate coverage % as: (completed tests / total tests) * 100
5. Move to ðŸŸ¢ when coverage >90%
6. Add your GitHub username as Owner when taking responsibility

### Test-First Development Process
1. **Pick a feature** from the priority queue
2. **Write failing tests** based on the test counts
3. **Run tests** to verify they fail
4. **Implement feature** until tests pass
5. **Refactor** with confidence
6. **Update this document** with progress

### Adding New Features
1. Use next available ID in category (e.g., WSL-007)
2. Define total test counts based on:
   - Unit: One test per public method + edge cases
   - Integration: One test per interaction point
   - E2E: One test per user workflow
3. Set appropriate priority level
4. Add to priority queue if Critical or High

### Calculating Coverage Percentages
```
Feature Coverage % = (Completed Tests / Total Tests) Ã— 100
Overall Coverage % = Average of all feature coverages weighted by priority
Critical Path Coverage % = Average of Critical priority features only
```

### AI-Assisted Test Writing
This project is optimized for AI coding assistants. When using tools like Aider or Claude Code:
1. Point them to this document for context
2. Ask them to write tests for a specific Feature ID
3. Have them update the test counts after writing
4. Request they follow the templates in TESTING.md

## WebdriverIO E2E Test Focus Areas

Since UI testing is critical for this extension and AI tools need to interact with it:

### Primary E2E Scenarios
1. **Complete Distribution Creation Flow**: Template selection â†’ Name input â†’ Creation â†’ Verification
2. **Terminal Integration**: Open terminal â†’ Verify profile â†’ Execute commands
3. **Tree View Interactions**: Refresh â†’ Context menus â†’ Drag and drop (future)
4. **Error Handling**: Invalid inputs â†’ Duplicate names â†’ WSL not installed
5. **AI Tool Workflows**: Create environment â†’ Install tools â†’ Isolation verification

### E2E Test Data Requirements
- Mock WSL command outputs for consistent testing
- Pre-created TAR files for import testing
- Template distribution configurations
- Invalid input test cases for security testing
