# Jest Timeout Issue - Solution Comparison

## Quick Decision Tree

```
Is this a new project or major refactor?
├─ YES → Use Vitest (Option 3)
└─ NO → Do you need Node v22 specifically?
    ├─ YES → Use Vitest (Option 3) 
    └─ NO → Switch to Node v20 (Option 1) ✅
```

## Detailed Analysis

### Option 1: Switch to Node v20 (Recommended for Quick Fix)

**Pros:**
- ✅ Immediate fix (5 minutes)
- ✅ No code changes needed
- ✅ Node v20 is LTS until April 2026
- ✅ All existing Jest tests work unchanged
- ✅ Well-documented and stable

**Cons:**
- ❌ Can't use Node v22 features
- ❌ Will need to address again in 2026
- ❌ Jest is slower than modern alternatives

**Best for:** Teams that need to ship quickly and have existing Jest infrastructure

**Implementation:**
```bash
chmod +x fix-jest-timeout.sh
./fix-jest-timeout.sh
```

### Option 2: Direct Node Execution

**Pros:**
- ✅ Works with any Node version
- ✅ Complete control over execution

**Cons:**
- ❌ Loses all Jest features (mocking, coverage, etc.)
- ❌ Manual test runner implementation needed
- ❌ Poor developer experience
- ❌ No VS Code integration

**Best for:** Emergency debugging only

### Option 3: Migrate to Vitest (Recommended for New Projects)

**Pros:**
- ✅ Works with Node v22+
- ✅ 2-5x faster than Jest
- ✅ Native TypeScript (no compilation)
- ✅ Better error messages
- ✅ Hot Module Replacement
- ✅ Jest-compatible API
- ✅ Modern and actively developed
- ✅ Better VS Code extension

**Cons:**
- ❌ Initial migration effort (1 hour)
- ❌ Some Jest plugins incompatible
- ❌ Newer ecosystem

**Best for:** New projects or teams willing to modernize

**Implementation:**
```bash
# Follow vitest-migration.md
npm install -D vitest @vitest/ui c8
# Update test files minimally
npm run test
```

## Specific Recommendations

### For Your Situation

Given that:
- You have an active development cycle
- You're using automated testing loops
- You need quick iteration
- You're already refactoring tests

**Primary Recommendation:** Option 1 (Node v20) for immediate fix
**Secondary Recommendation:** Plan migration to Vitest in next sprint

## Implementation Steps

### Immediate Fix (Today):
1. Run `./fix-jest-timeout.sh`
2. Verify tests work
3. Continue development

### Next Sprint:
1. Allocate 2 hours for Vitest migration
2. Follow `vitest-migration.md`
3. Update CI/CD pipelines
4. Train team on new commands

## Command Reference

### After Node v20 Switch:
```bash
npm test              # Run all tests
npm run test:watch    # Watch mode
npm run test:coverage # Coverage report
```

### After Vitest Migration:
```bash
npm test              # Run all tests
npm run test:ui       # Interactive UI
npm run test:watch    # Watch mode
npm run coverage      # Coverage report
```

## FAQ

**Q: Will Node v20 affect my production deployment?**
A: No, if you deploy to containers or cloud platforms, you can specify Node version independently.

**Q: Can I use both Jest and Vitest?**
A: Yes, during migration, but not recommended long-term.

**Q: What about other test frameworks (Mocha, Jasmine)?**
A: They have similar Node v22 issues. Vitest is the most modern solution.

**Q: Is Vitest production-ready?**
A: Yes, used by Vue, Nuxt, Vite, and many large projects.

## Final Verdict

**For immediate unblocking:** Use Node v20 (5 minutes)
**For long-term success:** Migrate to Vitest (1 hour)

The timeout issue is a known Jest limitation that won't be fixed until Jest v30 (no ETA). Taking action now prevents future frustration.
