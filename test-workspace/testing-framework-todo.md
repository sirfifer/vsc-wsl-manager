# üß™ VSC WSL Manager - Testing Framework Implementation TODO

**Document Version:** 1.0
**Created:** September 2024
**Owner:** QA Team
**Mandate:** NO MOCKS - 100% REAL TESTING

## üìã Executive Summary

This document outlines the complete plan to bring our testing framework to full compliance with the "NO MOCKS - HARD STOP" requirement while achieving 80% minimum test coverage across all metrics.

### üéØ Current Status (As of Latest Review):

**‚úÖ Completed:**
- Three-level architecture established (Unit/Integration/E2E)
- Testing frameworks configured (Vitest + @vscode/test-electron + WebdriverIO)
- Mock dependencies removed from package.json (jest, mocha, sinon)
- 7 real test files created with NO mocks
- 3 test helpers implemented
- Coverage thresholds set to 80%
- Xvfb installed for headless VS Code testing

**üîÑ In Progress:**
- Refactoring 41 mock-dependent tests (preserving test logic)
- 1 file successfully refactored: distributionRegistry.test.ts

**üî¥ Pending:**
- Complete refactoring of remaining 40 mock tests
- Create test fixtures (TAR files)
- Achieve 80% coverage target
- Full CI/CD pipeline integration

**Original State:**
- 86 test files total, 41 using mocks (48% contaminated)
- 22 source files requiring test coverage
- Mixed testing frameworks (Jest, Mocha, Vitest)
- Incomplete three-level architecture

**Target State:**
- 0 mock usage (IN PROGRESS - refactoring not deleting)
- 80% minimum coverage (100% for critical paths)
- Three-level real testing architecture (ESTABLISHED)
- Single framework (Vitest + @vscode/test-electron + WebdriverIO) (CONFIGURED)

---

## üìù IMPORTANT STRATEGY CHANGE

**Original Plan:** Delete all mock-dependent test files
**New Strategy:** REFACTOR mock-dependent tests to preserve valuable test logic

**Rationale:**
- Preserves ~2000-3000 lines of test scenarios, edge cases, and validation logic
- Only the mock implementation needs to change, not the test logic
- Faster implementation through refactoring vs. rewriting from scratch

**Refactoring Progress:**
- ‚úÖ distributionRegistry.test.ts ‚Üí distributionRegistry.real.test.ts (COMPLETED)
- ‚è≥ 40+ files remaining to refactor

## üîç Validation Checklist

Before declaring the testing framework complete:

- [ ] Run `grep -r "mock\|Mock\|jest\.mock\|vi\.mock" test/` returns no results
- [ ] Run `npm run test:unit` executes in < 5 seconds
- [ ] Run `npm run test:integration` executes in < 30 seconds
- [ ] Run `npm run test:e2e` executes in < 2 minutes
- [ ] Run `npm run test:coverage` shows >= 80% for all metrics
- [ ] All source files have corresponding test files
- [ ] No test failures in CI/CD pipeline
- [ ] Documentation reflects current implementation

---

## üö¶ Risk Mitigation

### High Risk Areas
1. **WSL Command Execution**: Some tests may affect system WSL state
   - Mitigation: Use test-specific distribution names
   - Cleanup: Always unregister test distributions

2. **File System Operations**: Tests may leave artifacts
   - Mitigation: Use temp directories
   - Cleanup: Implement afterEach cleanup

3. **Network Operations**: Downloads may be slow/fail
   - Mitigation: Use local test servers where possible
   - Timeout: Set appropriate timeouts

4. **VS Code API**: Some APIs may not work in test environment
   - Mitigation: Use @vscode/test-electron
   - Fallback: Document untestable scenarios
