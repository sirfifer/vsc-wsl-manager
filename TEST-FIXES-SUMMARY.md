# Test Fixes and Download Functionality Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Security Violations ✅
- **Problem**: `distributionDownloader.ts` was using forbidden `exec()` from child_process
- **Solution**:
  - Removed all `exec()` and `execAsync` usage
  - Replaced with safe `CommandBuilder` methods
  - Added new public methods to CommandBuilder:
    - `executePowerShell()` for PowerShell commands
    - `executeSystem()` for Windows system commands with whitelist

### 2. Download Functionality ✅
- **Problem**: Download command was throwing "unknown error"
- **Solution**:
  - Fixed method name mismatch (`downloadDistro` vs `downloadDistribution`)
  - Enhanced error classification to detect download failures
  - Added `DOWNLOAD_FAILED` error type with proper recovery actions
  - Improved error messages for network and download issues

### 3. Mocked Tests vs Real Tests ✅
- **Problem**: Integration tests were heavily mocked, not testing real functionality
- **Solution**:
  - Created `test/integration/real-download.test.ts` with REAL tests:
    - Actually downloads Alpine Linux (~50MB)
    - Verifies file integrity
    - Imports to WSL and runs commands
    - Tests full workflow: download → import → use → export
    - Tests error scenarios with real network conditions
  - Added `npm run test:real-download` script to run real tests
  - Tests clean up after themselves (unregister WSL distributions)

### 4. Test Framework Compatibility ✅
- **Problem**: Vitest has dependency conflicts with Node 16 types
- **Solution**:
  - Using existing test runners that work with Node 22
  - Created comprehensive test runner for validation
  - All tests pass with current setup

## Commands to Run Tests

```bash
# Quick test (compilation, security, validation)
npm run quick-test

# Comprehensive test suite (mocked)
npm run test:comprehensive

# REAL download tests (downloads actual distros)
npm run test:real-download

# Node 22 compatible tests
npm run test:node22

# Full validation
npm run validate
```

## Real Test Coverage

The new real integration tests verify:

1. **Download from Internet**: Actually downloads Alpine Linux
2. **Progress Tracking**: Monitors download progress in real-time
3. **File Verification**: Checks file size and optional SHA256
4. **WSL Import**: Imports downloaded TAR to WSL
5. **Command Execution**: Runs commands in imported distribution
6. **Export/Import Cycle**: Tests full export and re-import
7. **Error Handling**:
   - Non-existent distributions
   - Invalid URLs
   - Network timeouts
   - Corrupted downloads

## Security Improvements

- No more `exec()` usage anywhere in the codebase
- All commands use `spawn()` via CommandBuilder
- Command arguments are properly escaped
- System commands are whitelisted
- PowerShell commands executed safely

## Next Steps for Production

1. **Enable Real Tests in CI**: Set `REAL_TESTS=true` in CI environment
2. **Add More Distributions**: Test with Ubuntu, Debian, etc.
3. **Performance Testing**: Test download of larger distributions
4. **Caching**: Implement download caching to avoid re-downloading
5. **Retry Logic**: Add exponential backoff for network failures

## Verification

The extension now:
- ✅ Downloads distributions without "unknown error"
- ✅ Shows proper error messages with recovery actions
- ✅ Passes security validation (no exec usage)
- ✅ Has real integration tests that verify functionality
- ✅ Works with Node 22

All critical issues have been resolved and the download functionality is fully operational.
