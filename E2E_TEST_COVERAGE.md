## 🚀 Running the E2E Tests

### Prerequisites
```bash
# Ensure compiled
npm run compile

# VS Code binary will be downloaded automatically by wdio-vscode-service
```

### Run All E2E Tests
```bash
npm run test:e2e
```

### Run Specific Test File
```bash
npx wdio run wdio.conf.ts --spec test/e2e/two-world-architecture.test.ts
```

### Debug Mode
```bash
npm run test:e2e:debug
```

### Expected Results
- All tests should pass
- VS Code instance launches automatically
- Extension activates without errors
- All UI elements are present
- All commands are registered
- All workflows complete successfully

## 📝 Test Implementation Notes

1. **WebdriverIO Service**: Uses `wdio-vscode-service` to launch VS Code and control it
2. **Test Isolation**: Each test suite is independent
3. **Async Operations**: All VS Code operations are properly awaited
4. **Error Handling**: Tests verify both success and error scenarios
5. **Performance**: Tests include performance validation
6. **Security**: Tests validate input sanitization and security features
